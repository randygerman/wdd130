        <p>
            My name is Randy. I am from Ecuador and currently studying to become a Software Engineer.
            In my free time, I enjoy hiking. There are beautiful forests near home, so I often spend few hours there to
            relax.

        <p>Ecuador is known for its diverse landscapes, from the Amazon rainforest to the Andes mountains and the
            Galápagos Islands. It's rich in culture, history, and natural beauty.</p>
